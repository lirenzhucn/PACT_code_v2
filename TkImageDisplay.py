'''TkImageDisplay module

A tkinter widget that displays an image or a series of images with a specific
colormap. The module provides an interface function, which is similar to
matplotlib.imshow. The major difference of this interface function is that it
provides a set of GUI tools to do simple manipulation on the image, such as
saving the original and the colormap'd images into various formats at the
original resolution.
